Product Requirements Document: Catalyst IT Service Management (ITSM) Platform
1. Introduction
1.1 Purpose
This document outlines the product requirements for Catalyst ITSM, a comprehensive, user-centric, and commercially viable Software-as-a-Service (SaaS) IT ticketing system. Catalyst ITSM is designed for small to medium-sized businesses (SMBs) operating in modern, hybrid IT environments. This PRD will guide the development, design, and strategic decision-making for the platform.

1.2 Scope
The initial scope is to build a full-scale, easy-to-use ticketing system for internal IT support within a 100-user organization that utilizes on-premises Windows, Microsoft Azure, and Apple macOS. The system will be architected from the ground up as a scalable, multi-tenant SaaS platform, enabling future commercialization. The core philosophy is grounded in the best practices of the Information Technology Infrastructure Library (ITIL) to ensure operational excellence.

1.3 Target Audience
The primary target audience consists of two main user groups:

End-Users: Employees within a small to medium-sized business who need to report IT issues or request IT services.

Administrators/IT Agents: The IT team responsible for resolving issues and fulfilling service requests.

1.4 Goals and Objectives
For End-Users: To provide a simple, transparent, and frictionless experience for getting IT help, reducing frustration and increasing productivity.

For Administrators: To create an efficient, powerful, and data-rich platform that streamlines workflows, automates repetitive tasks, and provides insights for continuous improvement.

For the Business: To build a scalable, secure, and future-proof SaaS product that can be successfully commercialized, offering a robust ITSM solution to the SMB market.

2. User Personas
2.1 End-User Persona: "Alex," the Marketing Specialist
Description: Alex is a tech-savvy marketing specialist who relies on various software and cloud services to do their job. They are focused on their own work and see IT as a means to an end.

Needs & Goals:

A quick and easy way to report when something is not working.

A simple process for requesting new software or access to a shared drive.

Clear and transparent communication on the status of their requests.

The ability to solve common problems themselves without waiting for IT.

Frustrations:

Complex and lengthy ticket submission forms with confusing IT jargon.

A lack of visibility into the status of their ticket ("a black hole").

Having to repeatedly provide the same information for different requests.

2.2 Administrator Persona: "Sam," the Network Administrator
Description: Sam is the sole network administrator for a 100-person company. They are responsible for everything from network outages to onboarding new employees and need to manage a high volume of diverse tasks efficiently.

Needs & Goals:

A centralized hub to view and manage all incoming IT support work.

The ability to quickly triage, prioritize, and assign tickets.

Tools to automate routine tasks like ticket routing and notifications.

Data-driven insights to identify recurring problems and justify resource needs.

Seamless access to user and device information to speed up troubleshooting.

Frustrations:

Manually triaging a single inbox of mixed-up incidents and requests.

Users bypassing the system and reporting issues via informal channels.

Wasting time on repetitive, low-value tasks like password resets.

Lack of context when a ticket is submitted (e.g., which laptop model a user has).
